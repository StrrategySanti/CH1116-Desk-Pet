# CH1116-Desk-Pet
A desk pet made using an ESP32 board and 1.5 inch OLED screen that displays various bitmaps

My design uses 3 capacitive touch sensors to switch between the different bitmaps, which display variations of characters' faces.

I used image2cpp.com to generate the bitmaps code used in this project. The settings used are centered around the u8g2 library to ensure the image appears clearly.
